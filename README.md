GitHub Action: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-golangci-lint-with-reviewdog

#### Issue

I used this action to run golang lint checks on pull requests. In my case, I want specific version of golangci-lint. The action uses the latest version irrespective of the version input from the user.

#### Fix

Pull Request: https://github.com/reviewdog/action-golangci-lint/pull/170

Release: https://github.com/reviewdog/action-golangci-lint/releases/tag/v2.0.2
